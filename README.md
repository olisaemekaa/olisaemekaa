- 👋 Hi, I’m @olisaemekaa
- 👀 I’m interested in an internship or a junior role as a data analyst in any technology company focused on solving real world problems 
- 🌱 I currently just finished a course on data analytics, completed my capstone project and currently seeking for an internship role or a junior data analyst role to develop myself more with hands on experience, build a solid network and improve in my career as a data analyst while helping the organisation or company I work with achieve their goals and objectives.
- 💞️ I’m looking to build myself with hands on experience and solid networks, so I can collaborate with other tech skilled professionals to build a unique solution that will take world standard quality tech skill education to meet the young populations in Africa. This will drastically increase the number of skilled talents in Africa especially on relevant technology skills, which will be very instrumental in solving the world talent shortage in various technology skills, this will go a long way in reducing the poverty level, hunger, malnutrition and crime among African youths.
